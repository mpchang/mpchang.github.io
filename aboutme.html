            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="project-text">Hello, I'm Matt. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
                I received my PhD in optical communications from Princeton University, and my professional career has been split between building wireless interfaces for wearables and photonic integrated circuits for datacenter interconnects.
                That being said, I'm currently <a href="">making a career transition from hardware to machine learning software</a> and am actively seeking opportunities.
                I am a deep believer of fundamentals and being data-driven when it comes to solving problems. I am motivated by building product, and have a deep appreciation 
                not only for technical excellence, but also efficient business operations and transparent communication. 
                </p>

                <p>Outside of work, I love playing basketball and have followed the NBA since I was a child. My favorite team was the 2003-2004 Pistons, because they had no superstar 
                but played gritty defense with final scores hovering in the 70s and 80s. Times have been tough since then.</p>

                <p>About two years ago I transitioned from being a runner to a swimmer. 
                There are two aspects of swimming that I really like: (1) the focus on technique to make our bodies as efficient as possible in the water and (2) the calming, almost meditative effect when you're underwater and everything is quiet.
                I recently swam from Alcatraz Island back to San Francisco, which was my first open-ocean swim, and am considering signing up for my first (short!) triathalon.
                </p>

                <p>For you animal lovers, I have two kittens, Tofu and ChiChi, who I adopted in September 2023. They are once feral kittens, who have since mastered the art of engineering humans to get whatever they want.</p>
