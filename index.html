                        <p class="description">I was employee #5, and led the photonics team at Luminous Computing. Our team delivered the <a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-15-24926&id=532701">first monolithically integrated 112 Gbps PAM4 transceiver chips</a>, fabricated in the <a href="https://gf.com/technology-platforms/silicon-photonics/"">300mm GlobalFoundries Fotonix platform.</a> I helped build the design software infrastructure (simulation, layout, integration), the lab (including a home-grown 300mm wafer tester), and a team of 9 engineers from scratch. I also owned the key relationships with our photonics foundry partners (GlobalFoundries, SilTerra) and equipment vendors.

                        <p class="description">I received my PhD from the <a href="https://prucnal.princeton.edu/">Lightwave Lab</a> at Princeton University, with a research focus on building photonic integrated circuits for ultra wideband wireless signal processing.
                            For my thesis, I designed the first <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7913712">integrated circuit that reduced wireless interference over 1000x over every LTE channel</a> in existence at the time, using analog interference cancellation. 
                            I co-founded a startup company called Rebeless to commercialize the technology. The company was not successful, and it shut down in 2017.

                            At Princeton, I was a recipient of the <a href="https://ndseg.org/about">National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship</a> and the <a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/fellowships/princeton-fellowships/gordon-wu-fellowship">Gordon Wu Fellowship</a>.

                <p class="project-text">Every year the NFL and AWS host the <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/big-data-bowl/">Big Data Bowl</a>, a data science competition for football analytics. 
                    This year, my team won the Big Data Bowl using our metric, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/matthewpchang/uncovering-missed-tackle-opportunities">Missed Tackle Opportunities</a>. Missed tackle opportunities represent a new class of defensive mistake that is not captured by the current statistics: 
                    think of defenders getting juked out, making ambiguous arm tackles, or being lazy. To detect these missed tackle opportunities, we trained a custom XGBoost model that ingests player tracking data to predict, in real-time, each defender's probability of making the tackle within the next second. 
                    We verified the model's accuracy by successfully identifying ~90% of the 1100x labeled missed tackles, and on top of that, also identified an additional 3500x missed tackle opportunities that were previously undetected. 
                    Missed Tackle Opportunities <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/big-data-bowl/2024-big-data-bowl-winner-and-finalists/">won the 2024 Big Data Bowl</a>, and will be incorporated in the NFL's <a href="https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/">NextGenStats</a pipeline.
